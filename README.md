# Particle Simulator

## Introduction

This Particle Simulator is a graphical application designed to simulate the behavior of particles within a confined space. It uses SFML for rendering graphics and TGUI for the user interface, providing an interactive environment where users can add particles, define walls, and observe particle dynamics including collisions and reflections.

## Requirements

- C++17 compiler
- SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) 2.5 or newer
- TGUI (Texus' Graphical User Interface) 0.9 or newer

## Installation

To compile and run the Particle Simulator, follow these steps:

1. **Install SFML and TGUI:** Ensure that SFML and TGUI are installed on your system. You can download them from [SFML Downloads](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) and [TGUI Downloads](https://tgui.eu/download/) respectively.

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`, or download the source code as a ZIP file and extract it.

3. **Compile the Application:** Navigate to the directory containing the source code and compile the application.

4. **Run the Application:** Once compiled, you can run the application

## Usage

After launching the Particle Simulator, you will be presented with a graphical interface that allows you to interact with the simulation:

- Adding Particles: Use the input fields to specify particle properties (position, velocity, angle) and click the "Add Particle" button to introduce new particles into the simulation.
- Defining Walls: Specify the start and end points of a wall using the input fields and click "Add Wall" to create barriers within the simulation space.
- Simulation Control: Particles will automatically move and interact with walls and boundaries. You can add particles and walls at any time during the simulation.
